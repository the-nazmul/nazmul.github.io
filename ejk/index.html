<p>In the wee hours of Dec. 29, 2015, a group of men identifying themselves as “the administration’s men” broke into a six-story apartment building in Rupnagar, Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital city. They were looking for Al Amin Jony, an activist with the student wing of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the country’s principal opposition party. After identifying Jony’s apartment, the men broke its door open, tied up his septuagenarian mother and wife, and took him away, blindfolded. </p>
<p>Four days later, the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), an elite police unit run by officers deputed from the military, issued a press release, claiming Jony, 30, had been killed in a recent gunfight in Mirpur, Dhaka.</p>
<p>The killing of Jony was among the 2594 deaths documented by Odhikar, a respected rights group in Bangladesh, as “extrajudicial killings” caused by the country’s security forces since 2009 when the ruling Awami League government returned to power. </p>
<p>Extrajudicial executions <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/special-procedures/sr-executions">refer</a> to the deliberate killing of individuals outside any legal purview typically by state actors.</p>
<p>While deliberate and targeted killings such as Jony’s fell under the definition of extrajudicial killings, the Odhikar standards included impromptu yet arbitrary lethal law enforcement actions, such as lethal shootings of demonstrators and the deaths resulting from alleged custodial torture. </p>
<p>On Dec. 10, 2021, coinciding the Human Rights Day, the United States government <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0526">imposed</a> economic and other sanctions against current and former RAB commanders, holding them responsible for over 1,200 cases of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances. </p>
<p>Among other things, the Bangladesh government responded by <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/bangladesh-cancels-top-rights-group-s-registration-sparking-outrage-/6612568.html">canceling</a> the registration of Odhikar, whose dogged documentation of these state-sponsored abuses may have helped trigger the sanctions.</p>
<p>While Odhikar’s data has been oft-cited by the press and international rights organizations, the organization has not revealed the source of its statistics. Until now. </p>
<p>We have obtained the raw data compiled in dozens of asymmetrical spreadsheets by Odhikar dating back to 2009, citing media reports of the killings. </p>
<p>An analysis of the data reveals the extraordinary spikes in extrajudicial killings around disputed elections of 2014 and 2018, the disproportionate targeting of the alleged drug traders in the country’s southernmost district, Cox’s Bazar, where Rohingya refugees have been living since 2017, the regional nature of the killings, among other details.</p>
<h2 id="overview"><a name="overview" href="#overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>In total, the rights group documented 2032 incidents where at least one person was killed. All but 539 people who had been killed had an age recorded. The lion’s share of them was aged between 15 to 59, with people in their 30s to mid-40s accounting for 55% of those killed.</p>

</script></p>
<p>Based on an analysis of the sub-district-level location of the deaths, most deaths occurred in areas around the capital city. However, from 2018 to 2021, Cox’s Bazar, especially Teknaf, began to see a massive spike in extrajudicial killings. Many of those killed by the Bangladeshi forces in these periods were Rohingya refugees, who had fled their ancestral home in neighboring Myanmar to avoid ethnic cleansing in 2017.</p>

</p>
<h2 id="the-pre-election-spikes"><a name="the-pre-election-spikes" href="#the-pre-election-spikes"></a>The pre-election spikes</h2>
<p>The data suggests the pre-election periods in 2013 and 2018 recorded the highest spikes in killings. In May 2018, the deadliest month, the security forces killed at least 154 people, many for allegations of being involved in the drug trade. In Feb. 2013, as many as 63 people were killed in law enforcement actions. Overall, however, 2018 and 2019 were the deadliest years.</p>

<h2 id="who-perpetrated-the-killings?"><a name="who-perpetrated-the-killings?" href="#who-perpetrated-the-killings?"></a>Who perpetrated the killings?</h2>
<p>Bangladesh Police was by far the biggest perpetrator of extrajudicial executions in Bangladesh. Its members carried out more than half of the 2594 executions without any judicial sanctions. In addition, policemen participated in some of the joint operations with other forces that resulted in the killing of 142 people. </p>
<p><iframe title="Extrajudicial Killings in Bangladesh by Perpetrators" aria-label="Stacked Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-qWVm8" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qWVm8/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="600" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){“use strict”;window.addEventListener(“message”,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[“datawrapper-height”]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(“iframe”);for(var a in e.data[“datawrapper-height”])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script></p>
<p>In periods that witnessed a significant spike in executions, such as mid-2018, the police’s share of the killings increased even further. </p>
<p>Despite being a unit of the police, RAB enjoyed significant organizational autonomy, owing to its separate paramilitary-style command mechanism. Therefore, killings attributed to RAB were analyzed separately.</p>
<p>The third biggest individual perpetrator, the Bangladesh Border Guard (BGB), was implicated in 232 extrajudicial executions.</p>

</script></p>
<p>In addition to Cox’s Bazar, where security forces disproportionately killed Rohingyas and others, the Chittagong Hill Tracts saw the killings of ethnic militia members mostly killed the army. In some western districts, scores of allegedly leftist extremist groups were killed by security forces.</p>
